Sample app to show how to create an IOS app from beginning using Clean Swift. Routing options are slightly different then original clean swift architecture, but less code is required.

Using Moya networking to connect to themoviedb.org API and retrieve most popular movies in a tinder style card collection view. You can swipe left and right to determine whether you like the movie or not.

You liked movies are stored in Realm Database for later use. You can navigate to movie detail and watch the trailers
